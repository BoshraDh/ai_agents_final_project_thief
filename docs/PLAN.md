# PLAN — bb-ai-12 Thief Peer

## Source of truth
Game rules/binding parameters: `police_thief_p2p.pdf` v3.0.0 (book), Appendix ו for all
numeric values. Where this repo differs from the book, the book wins. Submission process
rules: `software_submission_guidelines-V3.pdf` (V3.00).

## Architecture (target, built incrementally — see Build Stages below)

```
CLI (cli.py)
   |
SimulationSdk (sdk/) -- run_peer: N-sub-game series loop
   |
PeerRuntime (runtime/) -- negotiate -> turn loop -> audit
   |-- state_machine.py   GamePhaseMachine, explicit legal-transition table
   |-- deadline_tracker.py / watchdog.py   reliability
   |
mcp/        FastMCP server (receive_move tool) + client (McpTransport) + tunnel
domain/     board, barriers, rules, scoring, protocol, pheromones, belief, negotiation
peer/       turn_handler, sealing, handshake, summary
crypto/     commit_reveal (SHA-256), step0 (hardware declaration)
strategy/   base (BrainBase), heuristic_brain (default), thief_brain, resolve_brain factory
llm/        provider_base, template (default), ollama, claude_api, claude_cli
report/     artifacts (4 JSON builders), emit, report_writer
infra/      email_sender (Gmail OAuth2)
shared/     config_manager (game.json+game.toml), api_gatekeeper, sysinfo, version
gui/        live_gui (local-truth heatmap), replay_viewer (SHA-256 re-verify)
```

Sibling repo: `bb-ai-12-police` (https://github.com/BoshraDh/ai_agents_final_project_police)
— structurally identical skeleton, opposite role's brain, mirrored ports (thief=8801,
police=8802). `config/game.json` in both repos must stay byte-identical (verified via
SHA-256 in the pre-game handshake, stage 6).

## Build stages (book's own priority order — each runs end-to-end before the next starts)
1. Base logic — grid, movement, barriers, capture, scoring. No networking. *(done)*
2. MCP infra — FastMCP server/client on localhost, no strategy yet. *(done)*
3. **Blind strategy** — heuristic move-decision (Manhattan + Bayesian belief), still no
   language/scent. *(current)*
4. Language + scent — pheromone math, free-text hints, LLM plugged in for banter text only.
5. Cloud exposure + tunneling — ngrok/Localtonet, environment separation.
6. Security — Commit-Reveal, Nonce, Step-0 hardware declaration, pre-game SHA-256 handshake.
7. Reporting shell — Gmail OAuth2 + Gatekeeper, Live GUI, Replay Viewer.

## Stage 1 — what was built
- `domain/protocol.py` — `Role`, `Direction`, `Position`, `GameOutcome`, `MoveAction` (shared
  value types, stdlib-only).
- `domain/board.py` — `Board`: bounds checking, legal directions, start-position lookup.
- `domain/barriers.py` — `BarrierSet`: read-only from the thief's perspective (thief never
  places barriers, but reasons about `is_blocked`/`as_list` when planning an escape route in
  stage 3+).
- `domain/rules.py` — `is_legal_move`, `resolve_capture_claim`, `check_survival`,
  `outcome_after_step` (single source of truth for "is the sub-game over").
- `domain/scoring.py` — fixed score table from Appendix ו (20/5/5/10/2/0), never edited.
- `shared/config_manager.py` — loads `config/game.json` (shared, signed) + `config/game.toml`
  (private), exposes `game_json_sha256()` for the future pre-game handshake.
- `config/game.json` + `config/game.toml` — populated with the book's binding defaults;
  `game.json` is byte-identical (verified via `sha256sum`) to the police repo's copy.
- `cli.py` — minimal `check-config` subcommand only; `peer`/`replay` subcommands arrive in
  stages 2 and 7.

No networking, no crypto, no LLM yet — deliberately, per the book's own warning against
skipping layers.

## Stage 2 — what was built
- `mcp/server.py` — `FastMCP(name="bb-ai-12-thief")` with a `receive_move` tool; stage-2 stub
  always replies STAY. `run_server(host, port)` serves streamable HTTP at `/mcp`.
- `mcp/client.py` — `McpTransport` wraps `fastmcp.Client`; `send_move`/`send_move_async` call
  the opponent's `receive_move` tool.
- `runtime/peer_runtime.py` — `PeerRuntime`: starts the server in a background thread, then
  `run_turn_loop(turns)` sends hardcoded STAY moves and prints each reply.
- `cli.py peer --turns N` — manual smoke-test subcommand.
- **Manually verified real round trip** between this repo and the police repo, each running as
  its own process on localhost (ports 8801/8802) — see `docs/PRD_mcp_infra.md` for the exact
  transcript and the known benign teardown-race caveat (fixed properly by stage 3's real
  turn-taking protocol, not patched here).

Still no strategy (hardcoded STAY), no crypto, no LLM — per the book's layering order.

## Open items / flags (tracked, not silently decided)
- **`num_games` figure**: the reference repo's README states "the guidelines book mandates
  6" for `network_and_league.num_games` (sub-games per series against one opponent, with
  role-alternation). Our `config/game.json` currently ships the book Appendix ו's own
  example value of `1`. This is a mutual, per-match setting — re-confirm the real mandated
  value against the book text before the first real submission-counted match, and update
  both repos' `config/game.json` together if it changes. See `docs/TODO.md`.
- `agreed_between` in `config/game.json` currently lists `"<opponent-team-code>"` as a
  placeholder — fill in the real opponent code once a match is negotiated, in both repos.
- `config/game.toml` `[game].members` lists placeholder student IDs — fill in real IDs.
