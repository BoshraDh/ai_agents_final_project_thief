# TODO — bb-ai-12 Thief Peer

## Done
- [x] Repo scaffolding (`uv init --package`), pyproject.toml (v1.0.0, ruff+pytest config).
- [x] `config/game.json` (shared, binding defaults from Appendix ו, byte-identical to the
      police repo's copy) + `config/game.toml` (private, ports/team/LLM settings).
- [x] Stage 1 — Base logic: board, barriers, rules, scoring, config loading. 31 tests,
      97% coverage, ruff-clean.
- [x] `docs/PRD.md`, `docs/PLAN.md`, `docs/PRD_base_logic.md`, this file.
- [x] `.gitignore`, `.env-example`, `LICENSE`, `README.md` skeleton.

## Done (Stage 2 — MCP infra)
- [x] Added `fastmcp`+`httpx` dependencies (`uv add fastmcp httpx`).
- [x] `mcp/server.py` — FastMCP server exposing a `receive_move` tool on `my_port` (8801).
- [x] `mcp/client.py` (`McpTransport`) — calls the opponent's `opponent_url`.
- [x] `runtime/peer_runtime.py` — turn loop skeleton (hardcoded always-STAY move).
- [x] `cli.py peer --turns N` subcommand for manual smoke testing.
- [x] Manual test: ran this repo + the police repo concurrently on localhost — real
      bidirectional round trip confirmed (see `docs/PRD_mcp_infra.md` for the exact result).
- [x] 37 tests, 93% coverage, ruff-clean.
- [x] Updated this file, PLAN.md, PRD.md, PRD_mcp_infra.md, README.md.

## Done (Stage 3 — Blind strategy)
- [x] `domain/belief.py` — `BeliefState`, exact position tracker from honestly-relayed moves.
- [x] `strategy/base.py` — `BrainBase` contract (`decide_move`).
- [x] `strategy/heuristic_brain.py` — Manhattan-distance search over `domain.rules.legal_moves`
      (default, zero LLM tokens).
- [x] `strategy/thief_brain.py` — evasion subclass (`_sign=-1`).
- [x] `strategy/resolve_brain.py` — factory reading `[strategy]` from `config/game.toml`;
      `game.toml`'s `[strategy]` section is now uncommented and live.
- [x] Replaced `PeerRuntime._decide_move`'s hardcoded STAY with the resolved brain's output.
- [x] Manual test: ran this repo + the police repo concurrently — real strategy confirmed
      driving outbound moves on both sides (see `docs/PRD_strategy.md`).
- [x] 46 tests, 94% coverage, ruff-clean.
- [x] Updated this file, PLAN.md, PRD.md, PRD_strategy.md, README.md.

## Done (Stage 4 — Language + scent)
- [x] `domain/pheromones.py` — `PheromoneField`, single-cell τij(t+1)=max(0,(1-ρ)τij(t)+Δτij).
- [x] `llm/provider_base.py` + `llm/template_provider.py` (default, 0 tokens) — trash-talk text
      generation only; the move is still never chosen by the LLM.
- [x] `llm/resolve_provider.py` — factory reading `[trash_talk]` from `config/game.toml`.
- [x] Extended the wire message shape (`direction`+`turn`) to also carry a `hint` field capped
      at `hint_max_words`, honestly relayed for now.
- [x] `runtime/peer_runtime.py` steps an `opponent_scent` `PheromoneField` from the tracked
      opponent position each turn (see `docs/PRD_language_scent.md` for why this is currently
      redundant with `BeliefState`, and what makes it load-bearing later).
- [x] Manual test: ran this repo + the police repo concurrently — real, distinct hint text
      confirmed flowing on outbound turns on both sides (see `docs/PRD_language_scent.md`).
- [x] 57 tests, 95% coverage, ruff-clean.
- [x] Updated this file, PLAN.md, PRD.md, PRD_language_scent.md, README.md.

## Done (Stage 5 — Cloud exposure + tunneling)
- [x] Picked ngrok (documented one-time setup in `docs/PRD_cloud_tunnel.md`).
- [x] `mcp/tunnel.py` — `NgrokTunnel`, starts/stops the tunnel and reports the public URL.
- [x] `cli.py tunnel` subcommand — prints the public MCP URL, blocks until Ctrl+C.
- [x] Documented the environment separation between "localhost smoke test" (`peer`) and "real
      match over a public tunnel" (`tunnel`) in README.md.
- [x] 61 tests, 92% coverage, ruff-clean.
- [x] Updated this file, PLAN.md, PRD.md, PRD_cloud_tunnel.md, README.md.
- [x] **Explicitly did not run a live tunnel** — per a check-in with the user, that's her own
      action on match day (installing ngrok, creating an account, opening a public port are
      out of scope for this session to do unattended). See `docs/PRD_cloud_tunnel.md`.

## Done (Stage 6 — Security)
- [x] `crypto/commit_reveal.py` — canonical-JSON SHA-256 commit/verify, nonce via
      `secrets.token_hex`; `CommitRevealLog` seals + audits a full sub-game's moves.
- [x] `crypto/step0.py` — sealed hardware/software declaration (`shared/sysinfo.py`).
- [x] `domain/negotiation.py` — pre-game shared-config agreement check (`configs_match`).
- [x] `runtime/peer_runtime.py` seals every outbound move via `CommitRevealLog` before sending.
- [x] `cli.py declare` subcommand — manually run and confirmed real output, `verify()=True`.
- [x] 74 tests, 92% coverage, ruff-clean.
- [x] Updated this file, PLAN.md, PRD.md, PRD_security_crypto.md, README.md.
- [x] **Explicitly did not build**: the wire-level Commit→Acknowledge→Reveal exchange between
      peers, or `peer/handshake.py`/`peer/turn_handler.py` — both need the book's exact
      negotiation-protocol text re-confirmed first (see `docs/PRD_security_crypto.md`).

## Done (Stage 7 — Reporting shell)
- [x] `report/artifacts.py` — the four mandatory JSON artifact builders.
- [x] `report/report_writer.py` — writes the four files to `logs/<group_id>/`.
- [x] `infra/email_sender.py` — Gmail message builder + send wrapper (`gmail.send` scope
      only); consumes an existing `token.json`, never obtains one unattended.
- [x] `shared/api_gatekeeper.py` — token-bucket rate limiter + concurrency cap + retry/backoff,
      from `rate_limiter_gatekeeper` config.
- [x] `gui/live_gui.py` — local-truth-only Tkinter grid + turn banner.
- [x] `gui/replay_viewer.py` — step-through replay re-verifying SHA-256, "Verified OK"/
      "TAMPERED".
- [x] `cli.py replay --log <path>` subcommand.
- [x] Manually verified the full pipeline end-to-end on real files (declare → seal → build →
      write → reload → verify → tamper → re-verify) — see `docs/PRD_reporting_shell.md`.
- [x] 100 tests, 93% coverage, ruff-clean.
- [x] Updated this file, PLAN.md, PRD.md, PRD_reporting_shell.md, README.md.
- [x] **Explicitly did not build**: a `send-report` CLI command (needs game-completion
      detection first — still open, see below).
- [x] **Live Gmail OAuth setup — completed 2026-08-20, live with the user**: Google Cloud
      project + Gmail API enabled + OAuth consent screen + `credentials.json`/`token.json` in
      both repos, verified with a real send to `rmisegal+uoh26finalgame@gmail.com` via the
      live Gmail API (real message id returned). See `docs/PRD_reporting_shell.md`.

All 7 book-mandated build stages are now complete. Remaining work is the deferred
integration items below, plus playing real games once ready.

## Done (book re-verification pass — 2026-08-20)
The book PDF (and its pre-extracted text) turned out to be locally readable on this machine —
re-read the relevant chapters directly instead of leaving these as open guesses:
- [x] **`num_games` resolved: 6, and it is FIXED (not negotiable)** — book Table 18
      ("פרמטרי הרשת והליגה" / Network & League Parameters), row 1: "מספר המשחקונים בסדרה מול
      יריבה" (sub-games per series against one opponent) = `6`, status `קבוע` (constant).
      Deviating from a "constant"-status value disqualifies the team per the book's own status
      definitions. Fixed `config/game.json` in both repos from `1` to `6`; re-verified
      byte-identical via `sha256sum`. This was a real, disqualification-risk bug, not just an
      open question.
- [x] **Fixed a real cryptographic bug in `crypto/commit_reveal.py`**: the book's exact
      formula (ch.5.3, with a full Python `commit()`/`verify()` code sample) is
      `Hcommit = SHA256(canonical_json({...payload, "nonce": nonce}))` — the nonce is one more
      field *inside* the single canonically-serialized JSON record. `compute_commitment` was
      instead concatenating `canonical_json(payload) + nonce` as two separate strings, which
      produces a different (still internally-consistent, but not book-compliant) hash. Fixed
      to match the book exactly; added a test (`test_compute_commitment_matches_the_books_
      exact_formula`) that pins the byte-for-byte formula.
- [x] **Added `runtime/state_machine.py` — `GamePhaseMachine`**, reproduced from the book's
      own example code (ch.8.3, "Orchestrator and State Machine"), confirmed verbatim against
      the book text: `WAITING_FOR_OPPONENT → COMPUTING_MOVE → COMMITTING → AWAITING_REVEAL →
      VERIFYING → WAITING_FOR_OPPONENT`, with `TECHNICAL_LOSS` reachable from `COMPUTING_MOVE`
      or `AWAITING_REVEAL` as a terminal state. Not yet wired into `PeerRuntime` — see the open
      flag below.
- [x] 107 tests, 92% coverage, ruff-clean in both repos.
- [x] Confirmed (book Table 19, "Gatekeeper" parameters) that every other value already in
      `rate_limiter_gatekeeper` matches the book exactly: `requests_per_minute≥30`,
      `concurrent_requests≥2`, `retry_backoff_sec≥5`, `max_retries≥3`, `queue_depth≥100`,
      `response_timeout_sec=30` (negotiated), `watchdog_timeout_sec=60` (negotiated) — no
      changes needed there.
- [x] Confirmed the book's Step-0 section (ch.5.5) says the hardware/software declaration is
      "cryptographically signed using a key supplied in advance" (`מפתח המסופק מראש`) — this
      phrasing suggests a real pre-issued signing key may be intended, not necessarily the
      commit-reveal SHA-256 sealing this repo currently uses for Step-0. No such key has been
      supplied to this project yet, so `crypto/step0.py`'s current sealing approach is left as
      is (still the most defensible reading available), but this is now a *sharper* open
      question than before — see the open flag below.

## Done (real turn-taking protocol — 2026-08-20)
- [x] **Resolved the turn-alternation-vs-simultaneous-round question**: book ch.4.3 confirms
      pheromone decay runs "after both the cop and the thief have completed their move" for
      a turn — a joint round, not chess-style alternation.
- [x] `peer/turn_handler.py` — `TurnHandler`, real per-round protocol bookkeeping.
- [x] `mcp/server.py` rewritten (`build_server`, `submit_commit`/`submit_reveal`) — replaces
      `receive_move` entirely; `mcp/client.py` gains `send_commit`/`send_reveal`.
- [x] `runtime/peer_runtime.py`'s `run_turn_loop` rewritten around the real per-round cycle,
      driven by `GamePhaseMachine` (network failures → `TECHNICAL_LOSS`).
- [x] **Manually verified with a real two-process run — genuinely bidirectional**: both peers
      committed, revealed real strategy-chosen moves/hints, and received the *opponent's* real
      reveal back. See `docs/PRD_turn_protocol.md` for the full transcript.
- [x] 117 tests, 93% coverage, ruff-clean.
- [x] Updated this file, PLAN.md, PRD.md, PRD_turn_protocol.md, README.md.

## Done (automatic end-of-game detection — 2026-08-20)
- [x] `domain/rules.py` — `cop_and_thief_positions(role, own_position, opponent_position)`:
      maps this peer's role-relative `BeliefState` (own/opponent) into the rules layer's
      role-neutral `(cop_pos, thief_pos)` order that `outcome_after_step` expects.
- [x] `runtime/peer_runtime.py` — `PeerRuntime` now takes `role: Role` and
      `survival_threshold: int`; tracks `self.outcome` (`GameOutcome`, starts `ONGOING`) and
      `self.final_turn`. New `_check_outcome(turn)` calls `domain.rules.outcome_after_step` on
      the just-updated `BeliefState` after every round; `run_turn_loop` now stops early and
      prints a `GAME OVER: <outcome> — scores {...}` line (via `domain.scoring.scores_for_both`)
      the moment either capture or survival is reached, instead of always running the full
      requested `--turns N`.
- [x] `cli.py` split into a `cli/` package (`__init__.py`, `check_config.py`, `peer.py`,
      `tunnel.py`, `declare.py`, `replay.py`) — the flat file hit the 150-line cap once
      `role`/`survival_threshold` were added to the `peer` subcommand's `PeerRuntime` call;
      `cli/peer.py` now hardcodes `role=Role.THIEF` and reads `survival_threshold` from
      `config/game.json`'s `movement_and_barriers.survival_threshold`.
- [x] Both peers can independently reach the same CAPTURED/SURVIVED conclusion from the same
      round's honestly-revealed positions with no extra coordination message — a direct
      consequence of the P2P zero-shared-state design plus the existing honest-relay
      assumption; documented in `runtime/peer_runtime.py`'s module docstring.
- [x] 12 new/updated tests (`cop_and_thief_positions` x2, early-stop-on-capture,
      early-stop-on-survival, stays-ongoing-when-the-turn-cap-is-hit-first, plus the flexible
      `_runtime()` fixture all existing tests now share) — 122 tests, 92% coverage, ruff-clean.
- [x] **Found a real, 100%-reproducible protocol bug while attempting the live two-process
      verification for this feature** — see the new open flag below (not caused by this
      feature; pre-existing in the commit-reveal turn protocol since the last stage).
- [x] Updated this file, PLAN.md, PRD.md, README.md in both repos.

## Done (commit-reveal round-1 race — fixed, 2026-08-20)
- [x] **Fixed the round-1 race flagged in the previous entry.** Root cause was confirmed: the
      book's Acknowledge step ("ensure reveal only after BOTH sides have committed") was never
      actually enforced — `submit_reveal` answered immediately, which only worked if the
      opponent happened to have already raced ahead to prepare its own reveal locally first.
- [x] `peer/turn_handler.py` — `TurnHandler.wait_for_own_reveal(turn, timeout_sec,
      poll_interval_sec=0.02)`: blocks (short polling loop) until this peer has locally
      prepared its own round-`turn` reveal, raising `TimeoutError` if that never happens within
      `timeout_sec`. Turns the previous race into an implicit rendezvous: an inbound
      `submit_reveal` call now waits for this peer to catch up instead of failing immediately.
- [x] `mcp/server.py` — `build_server` gains `reveal_wait_timeout_sec: float = 30.0`;
      `submit_reveal` calls `wait_for_own_reveal` instead of the old immediate `own_reveal`
      lookup. `submit_reveal` still raises immediately (unchanged) if no commit preceded it —
      that check was never the source of the race.
- [x] `runtime/peer_runtime.py` — `PeerRuntime` gains `reveal_wait_timeout_sec: float`, passed
      through to `build_server` in `start_server`.
- [x] `cli/peer.py` — passes `reveal_wait_timeout_sec=shared["network_and_league"]
      ["response_timeout_sec"]` (reuses the existing book-mandated config value, `30`, rather
      than inventing a new constant — NFR-4).
- [x] 6 new/updated tests (turn_handler: returns-immediately / blocks-until-another-thread /
      times-out; mcp/server: waits-for-another-thread / times-out) — 127 tests, 92% coverage,
      ruff-clean.
- [x] **Re-ran the live two-process verification that originally surfaced the bug — now
      succeeds.** `bb-ai-12-police peer --turns 40` + `bb-ai-12-thief peer --turns 40`, both
      started as independent processes: real bidirectional commit-reveal exchange every round
      from turn 1 through turn 35 (previously died on round 1, 2/2 attempts), police correctly
      auto-detected `GAME OVER: survived — scores {'police': 5, 'thief': 10}` at turn 35 and
      exited cleanly (exit 0). No stray processes left bound to ports 8801/8802 afterward.
- [x] **Thief's process exited with an error at turn 35** — the *different*, already-documented
      "benign teardown race" (since stage 2: "the shorter-running side's script exits
      mid-flight"), not the round-1 bug: whichever side reaches `GAME OVER` first was exiting
      immediately with no grace period, so the other side's in-flight final-round outbound call
      could land after that server had already torn down. **Also fixed, same day** — see below.

## Done (benign teardown race — fixed, 2026-08-20)
- [x] `cli/peer.py` — after `run_turn_loop` returns, if `runtime.outcome` is no longer
      `ONGOING` the process now sleeps `_SHUTDOWN_GRACE_SEC = 3.0` seconds before exiting,
      keeping this peer's (daemon-thread) server alive long enough for the opponent's
      straggling final-round call to land, instead of exiting the instant the local loop ends.
- [x] Re-ran the live two-process verification once more: both `bb-ai-12-police peer --turns
      40` and `bb-ai-12-thief peer --turns 40` now exit with code 0 and zero errors in either
      log — both sides independently printed `GAME OVER: survived — scores {'police': 5,
      'thief': 10}` at turn 35. No stray processes left on ports 8801/8802 afterward.
- [x] 127 tests, 93% coverage, ruff-clean (no test file changes needed — this is a thin,
      CLI-layer timing fix with no new branching logic to unit test beyond what coverage
      already exercises indirectly).
- [x] Not a mathematically airtight fix (a sufeciently slow opponent could still in theory miss
      a 3-second window), but reduces the failure window from "always, if timing is close" to
      "a multi-second grace period," which matched the "fix it if it's easy" ask — a fully
      deterministic fix (e.g. an explicit final handshake before either side may exit) is a
      larger protocol change, not pursued here.

## Open flags (not blocking, must resolve before a real submission-counted match)
- [ ] **Step-0 "signing" key** — book ch.5.5 mentions signing with "a key supplied in
      advance"; no such key has been issued/found yet. Revisit if/when one is supplied (e.g.
      in a course announcement or the reference repo's own Step-0 code), and treat the current
      SHA-256-commit-reveal-based sealing as a placeholder until then.
- [ ] Replace `agreed_between: ["bb-ai-12", "<opponent-team-code>"]` with the real opponent
      code once a match is negotiated (both repos, kept byte-identical).
- [ ] Replace `[game].members` placeholder student IDs in `config/game.toml`.
- [ ] **Barrier-aware routing** — `ThiefBrain` only ever chooses a movement direction against
      the empty `BarrierSet` this peer starts with; it doesn't yet reason about the police's
      actual barrier placements, and the commit-reveal wire protocol's `state`/`move` fields
      don't carry barrier messages yet.
- [ ] **Deceptive hints** — the real turn protocol's `intent` field ("truth"/"lie") is now
      wired end-to-end over the wire, but nothing ever sets it to `"lie"` yet — `TemplateProvider`
      lines aren't factual claims. FR-8's thief-deception allowance needs real position-claim
      logic behind this field. See `docs/PRD_turn_protocol.md`.
- [ ] **Real negotiation handshake beyond config-agreement** — `domain.negotiation.
      configs_match` only checks `config/game.json` byte-identity; game_id assignment and any
      other pre-game agreement steps aren't built.
- [ ] **Mutual end-of-game audit exchange** — each peer's `CommitRevealLog` already
      self-audits; peers don't yet exchange final logs with each other for a true *mutual*
      audit (book ch.5.4).
- [ ] **Pheromone spatial spread** — re-confirm the book's exact spatial falloff shape for
      `pheromone_grid_size` (uniform vs. weighted neighborhood deposit) before implementing
      anything beyond the current single-cell deposit in `domain/pheromones.py`.
- [ ] **Live ngrok tunnel** — `mcp/tunnel.py` is built and unit-tested but never run live this
      session (see `docs/PRD_cloud_tunnel.md`); the user runs `bb-ai-12-thief tunnel` herself
      once ngrok is installed and she's ready for a real match.
- [ ] **`send-report` command** — game-completion detection is now built (see "Done
      (automatic end-of-game detection)" above), so a `send-report` CLI command that builds +
      emails the four JSON artifacts automatically once `PeerRuntime.outcome` leaves `ONGOING`
      can now be built meaningfully (see `docs/PRD_reporting_shell.md`).
- [ ] **Known test flakiness (environmental, not a code bug)**: `tests/gui/` occasionally hits
      `_tkinter.TclError: Can't find a usable init.tcl` under this Windows machine's file-I/O
      contention when many Tk interpreters are created/destroyed back-to-back in one `pytest`
      run. Re-running always passes cleanly; the GUI code itself is correct (verified via
      multiple clean full-suite runs). Not worth chasing further in this session.

## Later stages (tracked here for visibility, detailed in their own PRD_*.md once started)
- [ ] Write the full 6-section academic report in README.md (rules model, communication
      approach, decision-making, LLM usage, live-GUI verification, replay-viewer
      verification) — the underlying code for all six now exists, per `docs/PLAN.md`.
- [ ] At least 2 full games played against a real opponent team before submission
      (`min_games_to_pass = 2`).
- [ ] `git tag -a v1.0-submission` once feature-complete.
