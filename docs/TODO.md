# TODO — bb-ai-12 Thief Peer

## Done
- [x] Repo scaffolding (`uv init --package`), pyproject.toml (v1.0.0, ruff+pytest config).
- [x] `config/game.json` (shared, binding defaults from Appendix ו, byte-identical to the
      police repo's copy) + `config/game.toml` (private, ports/team/LLM settings).
- [x] Stage 1 — Base logic: board, barriers, rules, scoring, config loading. 31 tests,
      97% coverage, ruff-clean.
- [x] `docs/PRD.md`, `docs/PLAN.md`, `docs/PRD_base_logic.md`, this file.
- [x] `.gitignore`, `.env-example`, `LICENSE`, `README.md` skeleton.

## Next (Stage 2 — MCP infra)
- [ ] Add `fastmcp` dependency (`uv add fastmcp`).
- [ ] `mcp/server.py` — FastMCP server exposing a `receive_move` tool on `my_port` (8801).
- [ ] `mcp/client.py` (`McpTransport`) — calls the opponent's `opponent_url`.
- [ ] `runtime/peer_runtime.py` — turn loop skeleton (no strategy/crypto yet — hardcode a
      trivial always-STAY move to prove the wire works end-to-end).
- [ ] Manual test: run this repo + the police repo in two terminals on localhost, confirm a
      move round-trips both ways.
- [ ] Update this file, PLAN.md, PRD.md again once stage 2 is committed.

## Open flags (not blocking, must resolve before a real submission-counted match)
- [ ] **`num_games`** — confirm against the book text whether the mandated per-series value
      is `6` (as the reference repo's README claims) or the Appendix ו example `1`; update
      `config/game.json` in both repos together if it changes.
- [ ] Replace `agreed_between: ["bb-ai-12", "<opponent-team-code>"]` with the real opponent
      code once a match is negotiated (both repos, kept byte-identical).
- [ ] Replace `[game].members` placeholder student IDs in `config/game.toml`.
- [ ] Decide `thief_class` in `[strategy]` once stage 3's `ThiefBrain` exists (currently
      commented out — default heuristic runs unset).

## Later stages (tracked here for visibility, detailed in their own PRD_*.md once started)
- [ ] Stage 3 — Blind strategy (heuristic brain: Manhattan distance + Bayesian belief).
- [ ] Stage 4 — Language + scent (pheromone math, free-text hints, template LLM banter,
      including deceptive hints as a legitimate thief tactic).
- [ ] Stage 5 — Cloud exposure + tunneling (ngrok/Localtonet).
- [ ] Stage 6 — Security (commit-reveal, nonce, Step-0 declaration, SHA-256 handshake).
- [ ] Stage 7 — Reporting shell (Gmail OAuth2, Gatekeeper, Live GUI, Replay Viewer).
- [ ] At least 2 full games played against a real opponent team before submission
      (`min_games_to_pass = 2`).
- [ ] `git tag -a v1.0-submission` once feature-complete.
