# TODO — bb-ai-12 Thief Peer

## Done
- [x] Repo scaffolding (`uv init --package`), pyproject.toml (v1.0.0, ruff+pytest config).
- [x] `config/game.json` (shared, binding defaults from Appendix ו, byte-identical to the
      police repo's copy) + `config/game.toml` (private, ports/team/LLM settings).
- [x] Stage 1 — Base logic: board, barriers, rules, scoring, config loading. 31 tests,
      97% coverage, ruff-clean.
- [x] `docs/PRD.md`, `docs/PLAN.md`, `docs/PRD_base_logic.md`, this file.
- [x] `.gitignore`, `.env-example`, `LICENSE`, `README.md` skeleton.

## Done (Stage 2 — MCP infra)
- [x] Added `fastmcp`+`httpx` dependencies (`uv add fastmcp httpx`).
- [x] `mcp/server.py` — FastMCP server exposing a `receive_move` tool on `my_port` (8801).
- [x] `mcp/client.py` (`McpTransport`) — calls the opponent's `opponent_url`.
- [x] `runtime/peer_runtime.py` — turn loop skeleton (hardcoded always-STAY move).
- [x] `cli.py peer --turns N` subcommand for manual smoke testing.
- [x] Manual test: ran this repo + the police repo concurrently on localhost — real
      bidirectional round trip confirmed (see `docs/PRD_mcp_infra.md` for the exact result).
- [x] 37 tests, 93% coverage, ruff-clean.
- [x] Updated this file, PLAN.md, PRD.md, PRD_mcp_infra.md, README.md.

## Done (Stage 3 — Blind strategy)
- [x] `domain/belief.py` — `BeliefState`, exact position tracker from honestly-relayed moves.
- [x] `strategy/base.py` — `BrainBase` contract (`decide_move`).
- [x] `strategy/heuristic_brain.py` — Manhattan-distance search over `domain.rules.legal_moves`
      (default, zero LLM tokens).
- [x] `strategy/thief_brain.py` — evasion subclass (`_sign=-1`).
- [x] `strategy/resolve_brain.py` — factory reading `[strategy]` from `config/game.toml`;
      `game.toml`'s `[strategy]` section is now uncommented and live.
- [x] Replaced `PeerRuntime._decide_move`'s hardcoded STAY with the resolved brain's output.
- [x] Manual test: ran this repo + the police repo concurrently — real strategy confirmed
      driving outbound moves on both sides (see `docs/PRD_strategy.md`).
- [x] 46 tests, 94% coverage, ruff-clean.
- [x] Updated this file, PLAN.md, PRD.md, PRD_strategy.md, README.md.

## Done (Stage 4 — Language + scent)
- [x] `domain/pheromones.py` — `PheromoneField`, single-cell τij(t+1)=max(0,(1-ρ)τij(t)+Δτij).
- [x] `llm/provider_base.py` + `llm/template_provider.py` (default, 0 tokens) — trash-talk text
      generation only; the move is still never chosen by the LLM.
- [x] `llm/resolve_provider.py` — factory reading `[trash_talk]` from `config/game.toml`.
- [x] Extended the wire message shape (`direction`+`turn`) to also carry a `hint` field capped
      at `hint_max_words`, honestly relayed for now.
- [x] `runtime/peer_runtime.py` steps an `opponent_scent` `PheromoneField` from the tracked
      opponent position each turn (see `docs/PRD_language_scent.md` for why this is currently
      redundant with `BeliefState`, and what makes it load-bearing later).
- [x] Manual test: ran this repo + the police repo concurrently — real, distinct hint text
      confirmed flowing on outbound turns on both sides (see `docs/PRD_language_scent.md`).
- [x] 57 tests, 95% coverage, ruff-clean.
- [x] Updated this file, PLAN.md, PRD.md, PRD_language_scent.md, README.md.

## Done (Stage 5 — Cloud exposure + tunneling)
- [x] Picked ngrok (documented one-time setup in `docs/PRD_cloud_tunnel.md`).
- [x] `mcp/tunnel.py` — `NgrokTunnel`, starts/stops the tunnel and reports the public URL.
- [x] `cli.py tunnel` subcommand — prints the public MCP URL, blocks until Ctrl+C.
- [x] Documented the environment separation between "localhost smoke test" (`peer`) and "real
      match over a public tunnel" (`tunnel`) in README.md.
- [x] 61 tests, 92% coverage, ruff-clean.
- [x] Updated this file, PLAN.md, PRD.md, PRD_cloud_tunnel.md, README.md.
- [x] **Explicitly did not run a live tunnel** — per a check-in with the user, that's her own
      action on match day (installing ngrok, creating an account, opening a public port are
      out of scope for this session to do unattended). See `docs/PRD_cloud_tunnel.md`.

## Done (Stage 6 — Security)
- [x] `crypto/commit_reveal.py` — canonical-JSON SHA-256 commit/verify, nonce via
      `secrets.token_hex`; `CommitRevealLog` seals + audits a full sub-game's moves.
- [x] `crypto/step0.py` — sealed hardware/software declaration (`shared/sysinfo.py`).
- [x] `domain/negotiation.py` — pre-game shared-config agreement check (`configs_match`).
- [x] `runtime/peer_runtime.py` seals every outbound move via `CommitRevealLog` before sending.
- [x] `cli.py declare` subcommand — manually run and confirmed real output, `verify()=True`.
- [x] 74 tests, 92% coverage, ruff-clean.
- [x] Updated this file, PLAN.md, PRD.md, PRD_security_crypto.md, README.md.
- [x] **Explicitly did not build**: the wire-level Commit→Acknowledge→Reveal exchange between
      peers, or `peer/handshake.py`/`peer/turn_handler.py` — both need the book's exact
      negotiation-protocol text re-confirmed first (see `docs/PRD_security_crypto.md`).

## Next (Stage 7 — Reporting shell)
- [ ] `report/artifacts.py` — build the four mandatory JSON artifacts
      (`declaration_/config_/log_/result_<game_id>...json`) from `Step0Declaration`,
      `CommitRevealLog`, and the game's final scores.
- [ ] `report/emit.py` + `report/report_writer.py` — write the four files to
      `logs/bb-ai-12/`.
- [ ] `infra/email_sender.py` — Gmail OAuth2 (`gmail.send` scope only), attaches the four
      JSON files, sends to `rmisegal+uoh26finalgame@gmail.com`.
- [ ] `shared/api_gatekeeper.py` — Quota Manager + token-bucket rate limiter + DOS detector,
      per the `rate_limiter_gatekeeper` config block, protecting the Gmail send call.
- [ ] `gui/live_gui.py` — local-truth-only heatmap + turn banner (Tkinter).
- [ ] `gui/replay_viewer.py` — step-through replay reusing `CommitRevealLog.audit()` for its
      "Verified OK"/"TAMPERED" banner.
- [ ] **Gmail OAuth setup is a live, guided step** — per the user's explicit request earlier
      this session, walk her through installing/downloading whatever credential file
      (`credentials.json`/`token.json`) is needed, live, saying "okay, now do X" at each step
      rather than doing it silently.
- [ ] Update this file, PLAN.md, PRD.md again once stage 7 is committed.

## Open flags (not blocking, must resolve before a real submission-counted match)
- [ ] **`num_games`** — confirm against the book text whether the mandated per-series value
      is `6` (as the reference repo's README claims) or the Appendix ו example `1`; update
      `config/game.json` in both repos together if it changes.
- [ ] Replace `agreed_between: ["bb-ai-12", "<opponent-team-code>"]` with the real opponent
      code once a match is negotiated (both repos, kept byte-identical).
- [ ] Replace `[game].members` placeholder student IDs in `config/game.toml`.
- [ ] **Synchronized turn-taking / negotiation handshake** — still open (`peer/turn_handler.py`,
      `peer/handshake.py`); `mcp/server.py`'s inbound `receive_move` still always echoes STAY.
      Re-check the book's exact protocol text before designing — see
      `docs/PRD_security_crypto.md`'s design-decision note (this now also blocks the
      wire-level Commit→Acknowledge→Reveal exchange between peers, not just move relay).
- [ ] **Barrier-aware routing** — `ThiefBrain` only ever chooses a movement direction against
      the empty `BarrierSet` this peer starts with; it doesn't yet reason about the police's
      actual barrier placements, and the wire protocol doesn't carry them. Add once the
      message schema is extended (likely alongside the item above).
- [ ] **Pheromone spatial spread** — re-confirm the book's exact spatial falloff shape for
      `pheromone_grid_size` (uniform vs. weighted neighborhood deposit) before implementing
      anything beyond the current single-cell deposit in `domain/pheromones.py`.
- [ ] **Deceptive hints** — FR-8 allows the thief's hints to lie; deferred until the
      wire-level commit-reveal exchange above exists to make a caught lie costly.
- [ ] **Live ngrok tunnel** — `mcp/tunnel.py` is built and unit-tested but never run live this
      session (see `docs/PRD_cloud_tunnel.md`); the user runs `bb-ai-12-thief tunnel` herself
      once ngrok is installed and she's ready for a real match.
- [ ] **Step-0 "signing"** — currently sealed via SHA-256 commit-reveal, not an asymmetric
      signature (none was confirmed from the book text this session). Revisit if the book
      specifies real public-key signatures for Step-0.

## Later stages (tracked here for visibility, detailed in their own PRD_*.md once started)
- [ ] At least 2 full games played against a real opponent team before submission
      (`min_games_to_pass = 2`).
- [ ] `git tag -a v1.0-submission` once feature-complete.
