"""Deterministic position tracking from honestly-relayed moves.

Pre-crypto (before stage 6's commit-reveal audit) and pre-deception (before
stage 4's scent/hint layer), every move exchanged over `receive_move` is
taken at face value — so each peer can replay the opponent's moves from the
shared, public start positions (`config/game.json`) and always know its
*exact* position, not just a probabilistic estimate. This class is named
`BeliefState` (matching the book's belief-map terminology) because stage 4
turns it genuinely uncertain: once hints may lie and scent trails decay,
`apply_opponent_move` is replaced by a real Bayesian update over noisy
signals. For now it is an exact replay log.
