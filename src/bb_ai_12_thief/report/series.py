"""The match-level report: one `result_<game_id>.json`, one email, on a full series.

`emit_report` writes the per-sub-game artifacts. This module closes the match:
it collects the six sub-game logs, scores them with `domain.scoring`, writes the
MATCH-level result file that Table 20 (book p.141) defines, and sends a single
email with every artifact attached.

Two rules are enforced here rather than left to the caller:

- **Nothing is sent unless the whole series completed.** A partial match is not
  a match; the artifacts stay on disk and the series is replayed instead.
- **`result_<game_id>.json` is a match file.** Every sub-game's `emit_report`
  overwrites it with its own outcome, so the true match result is written last,
  from here.
