"""Orchestrates build -> write -> email for a finished game.

`PRD_reporting_shell.md` deferred a real `send-report` hook because no
caller had a real `GameOutcome` yet. `PeerRuntime`/`LeagueRuntime` now both
stop their turn loop with one, so `cli/peer.py` and `cli/league_peer.py`
call `emit_report` once, right after `outcome is not GameOutcome.ONGOING`.
