"""Step-0 declaration: a sealed statement of this peer's hardware/software
environment, exchanged once before a match begins (book's Step-0).

"Signed" here means sealed via the same SHA-256 commit-reveal primitive
used for moves (`crypto/commit_reveal.py`) — no asymmetric-key signing
scheme has been confirmed from the book text in this session, so this
module does not invent one. If the book specifies real public-key
signatures for Step-0, this needs revisiting before a real submission
(see `docs/TODO.md`).
