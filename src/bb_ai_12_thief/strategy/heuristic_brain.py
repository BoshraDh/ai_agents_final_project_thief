"""Manhattan-distance heuristic — the shared base for both role brains.

Chooses the legal move that most improves (minimizes, for a pursuer, or
maximizes, for an evader) Manhattan distance to the tracked opponent
position. Zero LLM tokens; ties are broken by `Direction`'s declaration
order so behaviour is reproducible for the replay viewer (stage 7).
