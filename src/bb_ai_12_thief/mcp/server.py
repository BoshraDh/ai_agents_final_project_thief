"""FastMCP server exposing this peer's inbound move endpoint.

Stage 2: proves the P2P wire works end-to-end. `receive_move` is the only
inbound entry point an opponent peer calls each turn; the hardcoded STAY
reply is replaced by the real strategy brain in stage 3. Stage 4 adds the
`hint` field (free-text banter, capped at `hint_max_words` by the sender's
`TrashTalkProvider`) — the inbound stub still replies with a fixed line,
consistent with the stage-3 decision to leave real inbound replies to a
later synchronized turn-taking protocol (see `docs/PRD_strategy.md`).
