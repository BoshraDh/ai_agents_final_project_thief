"""FastMCP server exposing this peer's inbound turn-protocol endpoints.

Two tools, matching the book's confirmed Commit->Acknowledge->Reveal
sequence (ch.5.3) applied once per round (ch.4 confirms a "turn" means both
agents have moved). `submit_commit` records the opponent's commitment hash
and acks it. `submit_reveal` records the opponent's revealed move/hint/
intent and replies with this peer's own reveal for the same round, waiting
(bounded by `reveal_wait_timeout_sec`) for this peer to have locally
prepared it if the opponent's call arrives first — see
`peer/turn_handler.wait_for_own_reveal` for why. `submit_reveal` still
raises immediately if no commit preceded it (see `peer/turn_handler.py`),
turning that protocol violation into an immediate, visible failure instead
of a silent trust gap.
