"""FastMCP server exposing this peer's inbound turn-protocol endpoints.

Two tools, matching the book's confirmed Commit->Acknowledge->Reveal
sequence (ch.5.3) applied once per round (ch.4 confirms a "turn" means both
agents have moved). `submit_commit` records the opponent's commitment hash
and acks it. `submit_reveal` records the opponent's revealed move/hint/
intent and replies with this peer's own already-prepared reveal for the
same round — so whichever side calls first completes the exchange for
both. `submit_reveal` raises if no commit preceded it (see
`peer/turn_handler.py`), turning a protocol violation into an immediate,
visible failure instead of a silent trust gap.
