"""`series-report`: file ONE match-level report for a finished series.

The book requires the closing report at the end of a GAME, not of each
sub-game (p.71), as a single machine-readable JSON attachment (p.78). This
subcommand collects the six sub-game artifacts written by `league-peer
--defer-report`, scores the match, writes `result_<game_id>.json`, and sends
one email carrying every artifact.

It refuses to send an incomplete series: a partial match is replayed, not filed.
