"""Turn-loop skeleton for one standalone peer process.

Starts this peer's MCP server in a background thread, then repeatedly calls
the opponent's `receive_move` tool. Stage 2 only proves the wire round-trips
end-to-end — no strategy, crypto, or scoring yet, so every move sent is a
hardcoded STAY; `_decide_move` is replaced by the real brain in stage 3.
