"""Turn-loop for one standalone peer process.

Starts this peer's MCP server in a background thread (still the stage-2
STAY-echo stub — see `mcp/server.py`), then repeatedly asks the resolved
brain for this turn's real move, sends it (with a real trash-talk hint) to
the opponent, and updates the local `BeliefState` and `PheromoneField`.
Full bidirectional synchronized turn-taking (so the inbound stub also
replies with a real move/hint) is deferred to the negotiation/turn-handler
work in a later stage — see `docs/PRD_strategy.md` for why that boundary
was drawn here.
